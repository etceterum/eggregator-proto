# EggRegator (prototype)
================

A 2007 attempt to create a non-conventional newsfeed reader for popular news sites such as digg and slashdot (back then).

Disclaimer: this was one of my first attempts to create a Rails app. I didn't know how to use migrations properly - hence the create.sql script; other parts of the code are probably pretty bad too.
*But*: it was working, it was fast and I loved using it much more than wildly popular newsfeed readers such as Google reader.

Too bad this forever remained in the prototype phase...
